    "## Introduction <a name=\"in\"></a>\n",
    "\n",
    "In this homework you will be working on an open-ended mini-project, where you will put all the different things you have learned about time series so far together to solve an interesting problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "A few notes and tips when you work on this mini-project:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Tips\n",
    "1. This mini-project is open-ended, and while working on it, there might be some situations where you'll have to use your own judgment and make your own decisions (as you would be doing when you work as a data scientist). Make sure you explain your decisions whenever necessary.\n",
    "2. **Do not include everything you ever tried in your submission** -- it's fine just to have your final code. That said, your code should be reproducible and well-documented. For example, if you chose your hyperparameters based on some hyperparameter optimization experiment, you should leave in the code for that experiment so that someone else could re-run it and obtain the same hyperparameters, rather than mysteriously just setting the hyperparameters to some (carefully chosen) values in your code.\n",
    "3. If you realize that you are repeating a lot of code try to organize it in functions. Clear presentation of your code, experiments, and results is the key to be successful in this lab. You may use code from lecture notes or previous lab solutions with appropriate attributions.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### A final note\n",
    "It'll be up to you to decide when you're \"done\" -- in fact, this is one of the hardest parts of real projects. But please don't spend WAY too much time on this... perhaps \"a few hours\" (15-20 hours???) is a good guideline for this project ."

In this data set, there are 3 files (`Temperature`, `Preciptation`, `Pressure` and `Variables List`), and the goal is to forecast the temperature for the next 10 days, one month and one year, and predicting whether it is going to rain or not. `Temperature` is a dataset with almost 60000 examples and 5 columns. `Preciptation` is a dataset with around 56000 examples and 4 columns. It shows the daily preciptation in `mm`. `Pressure` has around 52000 and 8 columns. You can use the information of all the datasets together.\n",
